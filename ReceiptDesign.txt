Receipt class holds single receipt info
- who paid for that receipt
- the total for the receipt
- if any roommates bought a single item for themselves, and how much it was

Roommate class holds single roommate's info
- their name
- how much they have paid for groceries/other items
- how much each other roommate owes them for individual purchase
    - this way roommate can be passed as delegate consistently

ACTIONS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN
- Main menu with each roommate
- a roommate menu for calculating different types of receipts
    -> select a receipt type (tip, no tip) and ask how many of that type of receipt
    -> add this to the roommate info
